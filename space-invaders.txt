What Characteristics Does The Game Have

- The space invaders move uniformly from left to right
- When they reach the edge of the screen, they all move down a particular amount
- Each time they move down, the velocity of the brigade increases slightly
- Each alien has 1 health
- Tank can only fire 1 bullet at a time
- Barricades which get diminished each time they are shot (how can I replicate this?)
